                    of all to be a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the
                    buffaloes to get out of the way.in

                    they were not
                    impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!
                    And
                    here's
                    an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>
